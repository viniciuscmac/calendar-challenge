Calendar-Challenge

After cloning the project, you can install the dependencies by running:

### `npm install`

After installing the dependencies you can run the project by running:

### `npm start`

The user can change month and year by changing the filter above the calendar. You can add a reminder by clicking the plus icon inside a day box. You can add as many as you want!

After saving, the reminder will display inside the day box, with weather information for the city you typed (if exists).

To edit a reminder, you can simply click on it, then you can edit/delete that reminder.

To clean and delete all reminders for a day, simply click on the times icon on the day box and confirm the exclusion.

To run the unit tests using cypress, open another terminal/bash while still running the project and run:

### `npm test`

Cypress will open and then you can select one of the files with extension .spec.js to see the live test.
